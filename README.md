# OpenGL-Base
Minimal OpenGL wrapper library providing a blank slate ready for writing OpenGL code. Perfect for learning/experimenting. 

Includes [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw), [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad), [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm), [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb), and helper classes for shaders and textures out of the box. 

## Building

### Using CMake
1) Create a build directory

`mkdir build`

2) Run CMake
   
`cmake -S . -B build`

3) Build the ALL_BUILD target
